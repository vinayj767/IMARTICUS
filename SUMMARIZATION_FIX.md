# PDF Summarization Feature - Issue Fix

## Problem Identified 🔍

The PDF summarization feature was returning a **500 Internal Server Error** when deployed on Render. The error occurred because:

1. **Missing Environment Variables in Production**: The Azure OpenAI credentials were configured in the local `.env` file but were **not included** in the `render.yaml` deployment configuration.

2. When the backend tried to call Azure OpenAI API, it couldn't find the required environment variables, causing the request to fail.

## Root Cause 🎯

- ✅ **Local Development**: Azure OpenAI credentials were present in `backend/.env`
- ❌ **Production (Render)**: Azure OpenAI credentials were missing from `backend/render.yaml`

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Updated `render.yaml` Configuration

Added the following environment variables to the Render deployment configuration:

```yaml
- key: AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
  value: https://devtinder.openai.azure.com/
- key: AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
  value: YOUR_AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE
- key: AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_DEPLOYMENT
  value: gpt-4.1
- key: AZURE_OPENAI_CHATGPT_MODEL
  value: gpt-4.1
- key: AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION
  value: 2025-01-01-preview
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

Updated `backend/routes/adminRoutes.js` to:
- Add validation for environment variables
- Provide more detailed error logging
- Return specific error messages based on the failure type
- Include response details for debugging

### 3. Created Test Script

Added `backend/test-azure-openai.js` to easily test the Azure OpenAI connection and troubleshoot issues.

## Deployment Steps 📦

To deploy the fix to production:

1. **Commit the changes**:
   ```bash
   git add backend/render.yaml backend/routes/adminRoutes.js
   git commit -m "Fix: Add Azure OpenAI environment variables to Render deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Render will automatically redeploy** with the new environment variables.

3. **Verify the fix** by testing the summarization feature on the live site.

## Testing Locally 🧪

You can test the Azure OpenAI connection locally by running:

```bash
cd backend
node test-azure-openai.js
```

Expected output:
```
✅ SUCCESS! Azure OpenAI is working correctly.
Response: Hello! How can I help you today?
```

## How the Feature Works 🎓

1. **Upload PDF**: Admin uploads a PDF document to a lesson
2. **User Views Lesson**: Student selects a lesson with a document
3. **Click "Summarise with AI"**: Triggers the summarization API
4. **Backend Process**:
   - Extracts text from PDF using `pdf-parse`
   - Sends text to Azure OpenAI with structured prompt
   - Azure OpenAI generates educational summary
   - Returns formatted summary to frontend
5. **Display**: Summary is displayed in a nice formatted box with sections:
   - 📋 Overview
   - 🎯 Key Concepts
   - 💡 Important Points
   - 📚 Practical Applications
   - 🎓 Learning Outcomes

## Security Note 🔒

**Important**: The Azure OpenAI API key is currently stored in plain text in the `render.yaml` file. For better security in production, consider:

1. Using Render's Environment Variables UI instead of `render.yaml`
2. Setting up Render's Secret Files for sensitive data
3. Implementing API key rotation policies
4. Using Azure Key Vault for enterprise deployments

## Verification Checklist ✅

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Backend redeploys successfully on Render
- [ ] Environment variables are loaded (check Render dashboard)
- [ ] PDF summarization feature works on production site
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful
- [ ] API calls are logged for debugging

## Additional Notes 📝

- The Azure OpenAI connection test confirms the credentials are valid
- Local development environment is working correctly
- The issue was purely a deployment configuration problem
- All dependencies (`axios`, `pdf-parse`, `dotenv`) are properly installed

## Support 💬

If you encounter any issues after deployment:

1. Check Render logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify environment variables in Render dashboard
3. Run the test script locally to confirm Azure OpenAI access
4. Check Azure OpenAI service status and quotas
