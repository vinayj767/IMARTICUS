🌐 Open: https://imarticus-lms.netlify.app

Steps:
1. Login as admin:
   Email: admin@imarticus.com
   Password: admin123

2. Open DevTools (F12)

## 🎯 What to Report

### **After 3 minutes, test and tell me:**

✅ **Success:**
```
"All working! Analytics instant on refresh!"
"Render logs show Redis connected!"
"Network tab shows 15ms on 2nd request!"
```

⚠️ **Issue:**
```
"Render logs show: [copy exact error]"
"Frontend error: [describe what you see]"
"Analytics still slow: [show network times]"
```

---

## 🔧 Quick Troubleshooting

### **If Redis not connecting:**
```
1. Render Dashboard → Your service → Environment
2. Verify EXACT values:
   REDIS_HOST=redis-17929.c100.us-east-1-4.ec2.redns.redis-cloud.com
   REDIS_PORT=17929
   REDIS_PASSWORD=SU8RJ5gG8kiQjl0ZwyoNEk4xFq4chpuB
3. Manual Deploy → Deploy latest commit
```

### **If analytics still slow:**
```
1. Check Render logs for Redis connection
2. Try incognito window (clear cache)
3. Wait for first load (populates cache)
4. Then refresh - should be instant
```
